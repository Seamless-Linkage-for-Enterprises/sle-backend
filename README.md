# Golang Backend with PostgreSQL and Gin

This project is a backend API built in Golang using the Gin framework. It utilizes PostgreSQL for data storage and follows a clean architecture with well-organized modules. The project is designed to manage four core entities: Seller, Buyer, Product, and Bookmark.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.23 or above
- Docker (for local PostgreSQL)
- PostgreSQL (for local or cloud database)
- Make (for automating common tasks)

## Docker Deployment (Render.com)

1. Docker Hub Image: The Docker image for this project is available on Docker Hub: ```bash manankoyawala/sleapp:v1.2```.

2. Deploy on Render.com:

- Link your Render account to your GitHub repository.
- Set the environment variables as mentioned earlier in the Render settings.
- Render will automatically build the project using the Dockerfile and deploy it.

## Database Schema

The application handles four main tables:

- Sellers: Stores seller information.
- Buyers: Stores buyer information.
- Products: Stores product listings.
- Bookmarks: Stores user bookmarks for products.

Each table has associated migration files to manage schema changes (up.sql for creation and down.sql for deletion).

## Environment Variables

- ```DB_USERNAME```: The username for your PostgreSQL database.
- ```DB_PASSWORD```: The password for your PostgreSQL database.
- ```DB_NAME```: The name of the database.
- ```DB_HOST```: The host where the database is running (e.g., ```localhost``` for local, AWS endpoint for production).
- ```DB_PORT```: The port on which PostgreSQL is running (default is ```5432```).
- ```DB_SSLMODE```: SSL mode for database connection (```disable```, ```require```, etc.).
